Reading Annotated Analysis Grid (RAAG)

  ## Actions from the current Flows
* Collect Article in Bibliography (Zotero)
* Prepare Text for reading (SimpleNote)
* Listening to content and Dictation of annotations (iOS Shortcut)  (types : observation, concepts, resume, context, Project intentions, results, critique, notes) - Creation of types Not automated yet, Listening/Dictations flow contains many manual operation but provided sufficient pleasure/flexibility and enabled readind/annotating in new life context (such as when taking a bath ;) )
* Grid cleanup
* Creation of the synthesis sheet - (Should provide adequate picture so no return to original text is required)
* Observation of the RAAG (rendered Markdown)
